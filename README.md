#BLACKJACK RULES

Below are the basic rules that you will need to know if you want to properly learn how to play blackjack. They are used across different blackjack variations as the basis, with some minor altered features that make the variation unique in itself.

1. Blackjack games are usually played with multiple decks up to 8, although there are single deck blackjack variations. All use 52 card decks.

2. To win you need to have a higher ranking hand than the dealer as closest to 21 without exceeding 21. If the dealer busts, all remaining players at the table win.

3. At most blackjack variations the dealer hits on soft 17s.

4. The standard payout for hitting a blackjack is 3 to 2.

5. Cards are valued according to their face values. King, Queen and Jack and Ten are valued ten.

6. Aces are valued either 1 or 11, whatever benefits the player presently.

7. If you or the dealer goes over 21 it’s a bust.

8. The suits of the cards have no meaning in blackjack, only their values.

9. If you and the dealer both have a two card blackjack, it’s a tie.
